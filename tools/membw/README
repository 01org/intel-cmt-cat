Overview
========

The membw software tool provides a way to stress local and remote memory
bandwidth using a variety of memory operations. The tool allows the user
to choose an operation to generate a specified amount of memory bandwidth
on a selected core.

Requirements and Installation
=============================

For installation of the Intel(R) Membw tool follow below instructions:

To compile:
        "make" for building tool
        "make clean" for clearing all object files

Usage
=====

Usage: For Membw:
        "./membw"   This option will display usage and operation types

        "./membw <cpuid> <BW [MB/s]> <operation type>"

            <t_cpuid> Select CPU ID to generate bandwidth

            <BW [MB/s]> Select amount of bandwidth to generate

            <operation type> Select operation type from the following list
                -w        write - x86 stores
                -r        read - x86 loads
                -m        read-mod-write - load XOR write
