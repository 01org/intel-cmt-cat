Overview
========

This software package provides basic support for
Intel(R) Resource Director Technology (Intel(R) RDT) including:
Cache Monitoring Technology (CMT), Memory Bandwidth Monitoring (MBM),
Cache Allocation Technology (CAT) and Code and Data Prioritization (CDP).

In principle, the software programs the technologies via
Model Specific Registers (MSR) on a per core or hardware thread basis.
MSR access is arranged via standard operating system driver: msr on Linux and
cpuctl on FreeBSD. Presence of the technologies is detected via CPUID
instruction. In some cases CAT is detected via brand string read from CPUID.

Software detects presence of Linux perf extensions for
the monitoring technologies. In such case it enables library API's for
monitoring processes.

This software package is maintained, updated and developed on
https://github.com/01org/intel-cmt-cat

https://github.com/01org/intel-cmt-cat/wiki provides FAQ, usage examples and
useful links.

Please refer to INSTALL file for package installation instructions.


Package Content
===============

"lib" directory:
    Includes files of software library providing API's for technology detection,
    monitoring and allocation.
    Please refer to the library README for more details (lib/README).
"pqos" directory:
    Includes files of utility that provides command line access to Intel(R) RDT.
    The utility links against the library and programs the technologies
    via its API's.

    Manual page of "pqos" utility also provides information about tool usage:
    $ man pqos
"examples" directory:
    Includes C and Perl examples of Intel(R) RDT via the library API's.
    Please refer to README file for more details "examples/README".
"srpm" directory:
    Includes *.src.rpm and *.spec files for the software package.
    Please refer to README file for more details "srpm/README".

    Four CAT classes of service (CLOS) and a set of pre-defined classes that
    should not be changed at run time.
    CAT CLOS to hardware thread association can be changed at run time.

(2) Sixteen CAT classes of service (CLOS). There are no pre-defined
    classes of service and they can be changed at run time.
    CAT CLOS to hardware thread association can be changed at run time.
