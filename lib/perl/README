Overview
========

In this folder you'll find "pqos.i" a SWIG interface file
that allow libpqos usage in scripting languages (e.g. in Perl).
Currently full API is exported but only CAT related part was tested.


Requirements, compilation and installation
==========================================

Requires SWIG and Perl (-devel).
Tested with SWIG Version 3.0.5 and Perl v5.18.4.

To compile lipqos interface file:
        "make" for building SWIG Perl interface (Perl module and shared lib).
        "make clean" for cleaning.

Copy Perl module "pqos.pm" and shared lib "pqos.so" to one of the directories
listed in Perl's @INC e.g. to "/usr/local/lib64/perl5"
(run "perl -le 'print for @INC'" to list directories)
or to directory where Perl script using module is located.


Usage
=====

Add "use pqos;" to your Perl script.

Note:   In case of error while running script such as:
        "Can't locate pqos.pm in @INC ..."
        make sure that "pqos.pm" Perl module was copied to directory listed in
        Perl's @INC or to directory where Perl script using module is located.

        "Can't locate loadable object for module pqos in @INC"
        make sure that "pqos.so" shared lib was copied to directory listed in
        Perl's @INC or to directory where Perl script using module is located.
