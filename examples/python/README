Overview
========

This folder contains examples how to use Python Wrapper for PQoS Library.
Examples contain simple code snippets presenting usage of allocation,
capabilities, CPU information, L3 cache allocation and memory bandwidth
allocation. These ones might be executed by running the following commands,
respectively (please note they require root privileges, so it might be needed
to run them as root or with sudo):

        make run_allocation_example

        make run_capability_example

        make run_cpuinfo_example

        make run_l3ca_example

        make run_mba_example

All of the above commands will first create virtual environment in env/
and install the wrapper if it has not been created yet.


Monitoring example
==================

To run the monitoring example it is needed to install virtual environment first
(if not created):

        make env

It will create Python 3 virtual environment with Python wrapper for PQoS
library in env/.

Then the example may be run by executing monitoring.py script using installed
Python environment (root privileges required). To display help message,
-h flag can be used:

        ./env/bin/python monitoring.py -h

or

        source ./env/bin/activate
        python monitoring.py -h

To clean all Python cache files and env/ run:

        make clean
