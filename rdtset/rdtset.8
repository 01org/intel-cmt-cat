.SH NAME
rtdset \- Intel Platform Quality of Service
.br
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rdtset
.RI "-3 <cbm@cpulist> -c <cpulist> [options] (-p <pid> | cmd [<args>...]])"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Intel Platform QoS technologies (also known as Intel Platform Shared
Resource Monitoring/Control technologies) are designed to help improve
performance and manageability for virtual machines.
.PP
The rdtset tool provides support to set up the Intel CAT (Cache Allocation
Technology) capabilities.
.PP
The software provides flags to configure the
class of service (CLOS) and associate cores / logical threads with a class
of service. The Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor E5 v3 generation supports four
classes of service and a set of pre-defined classes of service that should
not be changed at run time.  Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor D generation supports
sixteen classes of service. There are no pre-defined classes of service and
they can be changed at run time.  Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor E5 v3 and
Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor D generations supports Core/Logical thread
association with a class of service can be changed dynamically.
.PP
CAT is supported on the following: 6 SKUs for Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor E5
v3 family: E5-2658 v3, E5-2648L v3, E5-2628L v3, E5-2618L v3, E5-2608L v3 and E5-2658A v3 2 SKUs for Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor E3 v4 family: E3-1258L v4 and E3-1278L v4 and all Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor D SKUs.
.PP
For additional CAT details please see refer to the Intel(R)
Architecture Software Development Manuals, Volume 3 System Programming Guide available at:
http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html
Specific information with regard to CAT can be found in
Chapter 17.17.
.SH OPTIONS
rdtset options are as follow:
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show help
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Verbose mode
.TP
.B \-3\ <cbm@cpulist>, \-\-l3\ <cbm@cpulist>
Specify L3 CAT configuration, multiple
.B cbm@cpulist
are separated by commas. 
.br
For example:

.B \-3\ '0xf@1'
.br
CPU 1 uses four cache-ways (mask 0xf)

.B \-3\ '0xf@2,0xf0@(3,4,5)'
.br
CPU 2 uses four cache-ways (mask 0xf), CPUs 3-5 share four cache-ways
(mask 0xf0), cache-ways used by CPU 2 and 3-4 are non-overlapping

.B \-3\ '0xf@(0-2),0xf0@(3,4,5)'
.br
CPUs 0-2 share four cache-ways (mask 0xf), CPUs 3-5 share four cache-ways
(mask 0xf0), cache-ways used by CPUs 0-2 and 3-5 are non-overlapping

.B \-3\ '(0xf,0xf0)@1'
.br
On CDP enabled system, CPU 1 uses four cache-ways for code (mask 0xf)
and four cache-ways for data (mask 0xf0),
data and code cache-ways are non-overlapping
.TP
.B \-c <cpulist>, \-\-cpu <cpulist>
Specify CPU affinity configuration, a numerical list of processors. The numbers
are separated by commas and may include ranges. For example:
.BR 1-3,4,5 .
.TP
.B \-p <pid>, \-\-pid <pid>
Operate on existing, given pid
.TP
.B \-k, \-\-sudokeep
Do not drop sudo elevated privileges
.SH NOTES
.PP
CAT is configured using Model Specific Registers (MSRs)
to set up the class of service masks and manage
the association of the cores/logical threads to a class of service.
The rdtset software executes in user space, and access to the MSRs is
obtained through a standard Linux*/FreeBSD* interface.
Under Linux, the virtual file system structure /dev/cpu/CPUNUM/msr provides
an interface to read and write the MSRs, under FreeBSD it is /dev/cpuctlCPUNUM.
The msr/cpuctl file interface is protected and requires root
privileges. The msr/cpuctl driver might not be auto-loaded and on some
modular kernels the driver may need to be loaded manually:
.PP
Under Linux:
.br
sudo modprobe msr
.PP
Under FreeBSD:
.br
sudo kldload cpuctl
